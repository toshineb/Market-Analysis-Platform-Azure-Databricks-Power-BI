# Market Analysis Platform

**Azure | Databricks | Power BI | SQL | Python (NLTK)**

> A production-style analytics stack that turns raw customer interactions, reviews, and campaign engagement into **conversion, sentiment, and product-performance insights**—end-to-end on Azure with Databricks and Power BI.

---

## 1) Why this project matters (for a business leader)

* **Increase conversion:** See where customers drop off and which products convert best, month by month, and fix the friction.
* **Spend smarter:** Compare Views → Clicks → Likes across content types to double down on the campaigns that actually move the needle.
* **Protect reputation:** Blend **text sentiment + star ratings** to catch “quiet dissatisfaction” early, not after churn.
* **Merchandise with intent:** Prioritize products by **price tier** and **review tone** to balance margin vs. momentum.

## 2) What a reviewer will see in 90 seconds

**Four Power BI pages** (screenshots below) that tie the whole story together:

1. **Overview** – executive snapshot of conversion, social engagement, and review health

2. **Conversion Details** – funnel by action, conversion trend by month, and conversion rate by product (e.g., notably strong “Kayak”, “Ski Boots”)

3. **Social Media Details** – Views/Clicks/Likes trend lines, content-type comparison, and a heatmap table by product × month

4. **Customer Review Details** – average rating, distribution by rating, **sentiment categories** vs. time, and a bubble chart of volume × rating × sentiment

## 3) Architecture at a glance

**Data flow**

```
Data Sources  →  Azure Data Lake / Azure SQL  →  Databricks (ETL + enrichment)
   (journey, reviews, engagement, products, customers)
           →  Curated SQL schemas / Delta tables  →  Power BI semantic model & reports
```

**Azure components**

* **Azure Storage / ADLS Gen2** for raw & staged data
* **Azure Databricks** for transformations (SQL+Py), deduping, enrichment, and conformed model
* **Azure SQL Database** (or SQL Server–compatible) for serving facts/dims to BI
* **Power BI** for the semantic model, DAX measures, and dashboards

---

## 4) Data model (facts & dims)

**Fact tables**

* **Customer Journey (fact)**

  * Deduplicates journeys using `ROW_NUMBER()` on key fields, uppercases stages, and imputes missing durations by date-level averages.


* **Customer Reviews (fact)**

  * Text cleanup (whitespace normalization) to standardize the corpus before NLP enrichment.


* **Engagement (fact)**

  * Normalizes content type labels, **splits combined “Views-Clicks” strings into separate columns**, and standardizes dates.


**Dimension tables**

* **Products (dim)**

  * Adds a **PriceCategory** (Low / Medium / High) for merchandising and margin-aware slicing.


* **Customers (dim)**

  * Enriches with **Country** and **City** via a geography join for regional performance analysis.


**Python enrichment (Databricks notebook / job)**

* **Review Sentiment (NLTK VADER)**

  * Computes `SentimentScore` (–1…+1), classifies **SentimentCategory** (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed) using **score + rating**, and buckets scores for aggregations.
  * Output is written to a curated table/CSV for BI consumption.

## 5) The analytics story in Power BI

### A. Conversion (from awareness to purchase)

* **Funnel by Action** (View → Click → Drop-off → Purchase) quantifies where users exit; combined with **month-over-month conversion** this flags seasonal dips and recovery.
* **Conversion rate by product** exposes winners (e.g., “Kayak”, “Ski Boots”) and underperformers worth UX, pricing, or promo experiments.

### B. Social engagement (top-of-funnel effectiveness)

* **Views vs. Clicks vs. Likes** over time shows creative fatigue and channel momentum.
* **Content Type comparison** (e.g., Blog / Social Media / Video) informs allocation of spend and production focus.
* **Monthly heatmap** per product reveals sustained vs. spiky interest patterns—ideal for editorial calendars and inventory planning.

### C. Customer reviews & sentiment (experience quality)

* **Average rating trend** sets the tone (baseline quality).
* **SentimentCategory × time** (Positive, Neutral, Negative, Mixed Positive, Mixed Negative) catches directional changes early—even when the average rating looks “okay”.
* **Bubble chart** (volume × rating × sentiment) surfaces **high-volume, high-risk** items (many reviews, mediocre rating, negative/mixed sentiment) for urgent action.

### D. Executive Overview (the “one-glance” page)

* A triad: **Conversion**, **Social Media**, and **Customer Reviews**.
* Quick KPIs (Conversion %, Views, Clicks, Likes, Avg Rating) + trend visuals → perfect for Monday stand-ups and monthly business reviews.

---

## 6) What’s technically notable (and interview-worthy)

* **Data quality discipline:** Window functions for de-duplication and consistent staging before BI; imputation only where justifiable (date-level duration averages).&#x20;
* **String parsing at scale:** Robust splitting of combined metrics (e.g., `Views-Clicks`) into typed columns for accurate aggregation.&#x20;
* **NLP that respects context:** Sentiment category leverages **both text score and star rating**, avoiding false positives from sarcasm or customer rating behavior.&#x20;
* **Segmentation for action:** Price tiers and geo enrichment enable targeted promos and regional playbooks. &#x20;

## 7) How to run it (cloud-first)

### Prerequisites

* Azure Subscription with: Storage/ADLS, Azure SQL, Databricks workspace
* Power BI Desktop (or Power BI Service with Gateway)
* Databricks cluster (DBR with Python 3.x)

### Steps

1. **Provision storage & SQL**

   * Create **ADLS Gen2** containers for `raw/`, `staged/`, `curated/`.
   * Create **Azure SQL DB** (or use SQL Server) and grant Databricks access.

2. **Load raw data**

   * Land journey, reviews, engagement, products, and customer+geography sources into `raw/`.

3. **Transform with Databricks**

   * Run SQL scripts to materialize facts/dims (see `/Data_Model/*`), or convert them into Spark SQL jobs:

     * Journey cleaning/dedup + duration imputation.&#x20;
     * Review cleanup.&#x20;
     * Engagement normalization + metric split.&#x20;
     * Product price tiering; customer + geography join. &#x20;
   * Persist to **Delta** or **Azure SQL** curated schemas.

4. **Sentiment enrichment**

   * Execute the Python notebook/script to score and categorize reviews; write enriched output to curated storage/SQL.&#x20;

5. **Power BI modeling**

   * Connect to curated tables, define relationships, and create measures (examples):

     ```DAX
     Conversion % = DIVIDE([Purchases], [Views])
     CTR %        = DIVIDE([Clicks], [Views])
     Like Rate %  = DIVIDE([Likes],  [Views])
     Avg Rating   = AVERAGE(Reviews[Rating])
     ```
   * Publish to the Power BI Service; set refresh via AAD-backed credentials.

## 9) Results you can talk about in an interview

* **Pinpointed drop-off** in the journey funnel and linked it to specific product categories and months.
* **Separated engagement vanity metrics from outcome metrics** (Views vs Clicks vs Likes vs Conversion) to guide budget reallocation.
* **Blended structured + unstructured data** (ratings + sentiment) to capture problems that averages hide.
* **Enabled geo- and price-tier slicing** so sales/merchandising can act on regional demand and margin trade-offs.

---

## 10) Roadmap (what I’d build next)

* Real-time event capture → **Event Hubs + Databricks Structured Streaming** → “Live” Power BI tiles.
* **Synapse Serverless** layer for ad-hoc SQL over the curated lake.
* Upgrade sentiment from lexicon-based to **transformer models** (e.g., Azure ML endpoints).
* **Data quality monitors** (Great Expectations) with alerting to Teams/Slack.

---

**Credits & Notes**

* Product **price tiering** logic for segmentation.&#x20;
* **Journey** cleaning, deduplication, and duration imputation.&#x20;
* **Review** text cleanup.&#x20;
* **Engagement** parsing and normalization.&#x20;

If you want, I can also save this as `README.md` in your workspace and include the images with relative paths so it’s plug-and-play for GitHub.
